# AST & ASG Graph RAG

## What is AST?
AST, or Abstract Syntax Tree, is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent every detail appearing in the real syntax.

### AST Example
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
The AST for this code might look something like this:
```
FunctionDef
  name: add
  args:
    arguments:
      - arg: a
      - arg: b
  body:
    - Return
      value:
        BinOp
          left: a
          op: +
          right: b
```

## Visual representation of AST

Code:
```
def foo(x):
    y = x + 1
    print(y)
foo(5)
```

## What is ASG?
ASG, or Abstract Semantic Graph, is a directed graph representation of the abstract semantic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node of the graph denotes a semantic entity, such as a variable, function, or type, and each edge denotes a relationship between these entities.

### ASG Example
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

c = add(1, 2)

```
The ASG for this code might look something like this:
```
Function: add
  Parameter: a
  Parameter: b
  Returns: a + b
  ------
Variable: c
  Value: add(1, 2)
```

## Visual representation of ASG
Code:
```
def foo(x):
    y = x + 1
    print(y)
foo(5)
```

# Diffeence betwenn AST and ASG
- AST focuses on the syntactic structure of the code, while ASG focuses on the semantic structure.
    - Example: In AST, the expression `a + b` would be represented as a `BinOp` node with `a` and `b` as its children. In ASG, the expression `a + b` would be represented as a node that denotes an addition operation, with `a` and `b` as its inputs and the result as its output.

- AST is a tree, while ASG is a graph. This means that ASG can represent more complex relationships between entities than AST.
    - Example: In ASG, a function call can be represented as a node that has edges to its arguments and its return value. This allows for more sophisticated analysis of the flow of data through a program.
- AST is typically easier to generate and work with than ASG, as it can be done using standard parsing techniques. Generating an ASG requires more advanced techniques, such as type inference and data flow analysis.
    - Example: In AST, the expression `a + b` would be represented as a `BinOp` node with `a` and `b` as its children. In ASG, the expression `a + b` would be represented as a node that denotes an addition operation, with `a` and `b` as its inputs and the result as its output. This requires more advanced techniques, such as type inference and data flow analysis.
- AST is typically used for tasks such as code refactoring, code generation, and static analysis, while ASG is typically used for tasks such as program understanding, program synthesis, and program verification.
    - Example: AST is typically used for tasks such as code refactoring, code generation, and static analysis. For example, a tool that uses AST to refactor code might be able to automatically convert a `for` loop into a `map` function. A tool that uses ASG to understand a program might be able to answer questions such as "What is the value of `c` after the function call to `add`?".

# Graph RAG
A Graph RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique that uses a graph database to enhance the capabilities of a language model. By combining the structured data in the graph with the unstructured text in the language model, a Graph RAG can generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## how to use AST and ASG with Graph RAG
- AST and ASG can be used to enhance the capabilities of a Graph RAG by providing it with additional structured data about the code.
    - Example: A Graph RAG that is trained on a corpus of code could use AST and ASG to extract information about the relationships between variables, functions, and types in the code. This information could then be used to improve the accuracy of the Graph RAG's responses to questions about the code.
- AST and ASG can also be used to improve the efficiency of a Graph RAG by allowing it to more quickly and accurately retrieve relevant information from the graph.
    - Example: A Graph RAG that is trained on a corpus of code could use AST and ASG to index the graph based on the semantic structure of the code. This would allow the Graph RAG to more quickly and accurately retrieve information about the relationships between variables, functions, and types in the code.
- AST and ASG can be used to improve the scalability of a Graph RAG by allowing it to handle larger and more complex codebases.
    - Example: A Graph RAG that is trained on a corpus of code could use AST and ASG to automatically 
extract and index the graph based on the semantic structure of the code. This would allow the Graph RAG to handle larger and more complex codebases without requiring manual intervention.
